For each file operand which is a directory, all the files\nin the directory (recursively)  will be watched.\n\nIf no files are specified, it's as if you passed \".\" as the file parameter.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`-c --chime minutes`\n\n> Write a diagnostic message after `minutes` have elapsed since last running\n> a command, to remind you `wr` is running.  The default is 5 minutes.\n> Use the value 0 to disable the chime.\n\n`-v --verbose`\n\n> Generate additional diagnostic information.\n\n`--exec`\n\n> Use exec instead of spawn to run the command.\n\n`-p --poll seconds`\n\n> Use a polling file watcher.  The default is to use a non-polling file watcher.\n> The non-polling file watcher\n> may have a relatively small maximum number of files it can watch (200),\n> but the polling file watcher has no maximum.\n> The polling file\n> watcher may incur delays between a file changing and the command running,\n> compared to the non-polling file watcher.\n\n`-V`\n\n> Display the version number and exit.\n\n`-? -h`\n\n> Display help.\n\nEXAMPLES\n--------\n\nThe following is how to run make when any file in the current directory\nchanges:\n\n        wr make\n\nMore likely you can whittle the list of source files checked a bit.  The\nfollowing will run make any file in the `src`, `doc` or `test` directories\nchanges:\n\n        wr make src doc test\n\nTo run a command with arguments, quote the command you want to run.  The\nfollowing will run the command \"`echo a file changed`\" when any file in the\ncurrent directory changes:\n\n        wr \"echo a file changed\"\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n-----------\n\nwr will not normally exit.   Use ctrl-c or equivalent to kill the process\nfrom the command-line.\n\nDiagnostic information from `wr` will be written to stderr.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n-----------\n\nIf the current directory has a `.wr` file in it, that file is assumed\nto have the contents of a `wr` invocation in it.  Options, option/value\npairs, the command to run, and each file to be watched should be\nspecified on separate lines.\nThe file may contain blank lines or lines starting with the `#` character,\nwhich are considered comments.\n\nThe stdout and stderr from the command being run are passed directory to\n`wr`'s stdout and stderr.  stdin for the command will not be available\nfor the command.\n\nThe command will be run in either spawn or exec mode, as determined by\ncommand-line options.  Here are the differences:\n\nexec:\n\n* the command will not be parsed, as will be run as given\n* should handle i/o redirection shell operators\n* stdout and stderr output will be buffered until the command is complete\n\nspawn:\n\n* the command will be parsed into space separated tokens, probably\nmisinterpreting any quotes you have in your command\n* will not handle i/o redirection shell operators\n* stdout and stderr output will not be buffered\n\nHISTORY\n-------\n\n`wr` is a port of Patrick Mueller's [run-when-changed.py](https://gist.github.com/240922)\nscript to node.\n\n**2012-05-03: version 1.2.0**\n\n* [commit d684efb7](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/commit/d684efb7182bd866c875be2bb459a692a5661599) - replaced charm w/colors\n\n**2012-05-03: version 1.2.0**\n\n* [issue 8](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/8) - add elapsed time to success and failure messages\n* fixed bug where wr fired off it's command when the access time changed on a file\n\n**2012-01-11: version 1.1.0**\n\n* [issue 1](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/1) - chime should print the time\n* [issue 2](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/2) - chime should default to 5 minutes\n* [issue 3](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/3) - .wr file parser should accept option/value on a single line\n* [issue 5](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/5) - provide option to use stat-based polling\n* [issue 6](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/6) - use spawn instead of exec to run commands\n* [issue 7](https://github.com/pmuellr/wr/issues/7) - colorize stdout and stderr\n\n**2012-01-10: version 1.0.1**\n\n* fixed some stupid bugs\n\n**2012-01-09: version 1.0.0**\n\n* initial release\n\n",
